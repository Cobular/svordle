# Svordle

A Wordle clone, made with Svelte, to help teach Svelte for my workshop at LA Hacks 2022!

## What's Goin On

On Main, there's a few things missing in the `.svelte` files!! We'll be filling them in as we go through the talk and learn about different parts of how Svelte works. If you want to see the reference, check out the branch `reference`.

## The Talk

Slide deck: https://slides.com/cobular/better-web-development-with-svelte

Video: I'll post this eventually â„¢

## Running

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
